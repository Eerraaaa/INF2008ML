# INF2008ML P5 Grp 13 Machine Learning Project
**Image Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms**

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies classical machine learning techniques to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. Various feature engineering techniques are implemented to improve classification accuracy. The project evaluates different machine learning models based on key performance metrics.

## 🎯 Objective  
To classify handwritten digits (0-9) using classical machine learning algorithms and compare their performance after applying feature engineering techniques.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used is the **MNIST database**, a large collection of **28x28 grayscale images** of handwritten digits (0-9). It contains:
- **60,000 training images**
- **10,000 test images**
- Pixel intensity values ranging from **0-255**

## 🏗️ Machine Learning Models Implemented  
The following classical ML algorithms are used:
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  
Each model is assessed using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision**: Proportion of correctly predicted positive samples.
- **Recall**: Ability to identify actual positive samples.
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Training Time**: Computational time required to train the model.
- **Prediction Time**: Time taken for the model to classify new samples.
